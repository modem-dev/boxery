boxery-host — Ubuntu desktop VMs for coding agents (backend: fake)

  init [--backend libvirt|lima|cloud-hypervisor|exe|boat|openshell]  install proxy services + backend setup, symlinks
  --profile NAME COMMAND…   use a second profile on this host (~/.config/boxery-NAME): its own backend,
                            state, proxy port and services. Create it with: --profile NAME init --backend B
  backends [--json]         backend support, requirements and capability declarations
  capabilities [--json | --check]  this host's platform, validation and conditional capabilities
  profiles [--json]         the profiles on this host (backend, proxy port, service name, state directory)
  version [--json]          this install's version, commit and kind (git or npm)
  upgrade [--check] [--ref REF] [--wait S] [--reinit]
                            update this install (git pull --ff-only, or npm), re-run init for every
                            profile using it and check them; waits for in-flight operations, rolls back on failure
  build-base                build the golden desktop image (one-time; headless VMs don't need it)
  add-key < key.pub         authorize a controller's ssh key for new VMs
  new NAME [--shape S] [--cpus N --mem MiB --disk GiB] [--headless [--layers github-runner]]
                            --headless: no desktop; boots the stock image, no build-base needed
                            --layers: optional image layers too (github-runner: a GitHub Actions runner VM)
  new NAME --from IMAGE     boot a new VM from an image (e.g. demo@s1; keeps its desktop or not)
  fork SRC DST... [--shape S] [--cpus N --mem MiB --disk GiB]
                            copy a VM (running or not) into new VMs with their own identity
                            (same size as SRC unless --shape or size flags are given)
  shapes [--json]           VM sizes (built-ins + TMP/conf/shapes.json; * = default)
  ls [--json] [--refresh]   VMs; --refresh first reads each running VM's guest build record (GUEST column)
  ip NAME | start NAME | stop NAME | rm NAME
  patch NAME|--all [--wait S]
                            update a VM's guest software to this host's image layers (restarts it if the
                            updates ask to; a pool VM must be free, and its clean image is captured again)
  resize NAME [--cpus N] [--mem MiB] [--disk GiB]
                            change a VM's size; a running VM is restarted. Disk only grows
  snap NAME [SNAP] | snaps NAME [--json] | snap-rm NAME SNAP | revert NAME SNAP | images [--json]
  connect NAME [PORT]       stdio to VM port (for ssh ProxyCommand)
  known-hosts NAME          NAME's pinned ssh host key as a known_hosts line (ssh KnownHostsCommand)
  pin NAME [--from-guest]   re-pin running NAME's ssh host key (hypervisor/loopback channel; --from-guest:
                            trust what NAME's ssh endpoint answers once)
  proxy-log [N]             recent LLM + edge proxy requests
  edge-set NAME [--lease ID] < routes.json   set the VM's edge credential routes (used by boxery grant http:…)

  pool add NAME | rm NAME [--force] | ls [--json]   shared pool of leasable VMs
  acquire --holder H [--ttl S] [--wait S] [--only NAME,…] [--json]   lease a free pool VM (lease ssh pubkey on stdin)
  renew LEASE [--ttl S] [--json] | release LEASE | reap | reconcile

  runners status [--json] | start | stop | token < FILE | config [--repo O/R | --org ORG] [--vms NAME,…] …
                            GitHub Actions runners, one job per freshly reset pool VM (docs/github-runners.md)
