// CLI ↔ agent-tool parity. Agents get the vm_* tools (core/boxery-tools.mjs, shared by MCP and pi);
// people and scripts get controller/boxery. Each side must account for the other: a new tool or
// action fails here until it names its CLI command (or says why there is none), and so does a new
// CLI command. Where both exist, prefer one implementation (boxery cp runs vm_copy's own code).
