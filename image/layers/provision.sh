# boxery-provision [LAYER...]: apply boxery's image layers (/usr/local/lib/boxery/layers/LAYER.sh) in order.
# Default: the layers listed in /etc/boxery/provision (written by boxery-host's per-VM cloud-config).
#   plumbing   every VM: agent user, boxery-llm (LLM proxy bridge), sshd/sysctl/cloud-init/tmux config
#   devtools   git, build tools, node 24, pi, opencode, ripgrep (keeps what the image already has)
#   desktop    XFCE, VNC/noVNC, browsers, playwright-core (the desktop base build only)
#   github-runner  optional (new --headless --layers github-runner): the pinned GitHub Actions runner
# Records what's installed in /etc/boxery/layers; /etc/boxery/headless marks a VM without the desktop;
# /etc/boxery/build-info says what the VM was built with (lib.sh, build_info). Running it again
# updates what the layers install (`boxery patch` does that with the host's current layer files).
