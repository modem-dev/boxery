//
// Entry: { name, title, description, parameters (plain JSON Schema, incl. `vm` and `host`), annotations (MCP
// hints), outputSchema? (MCP structuredContent), run(vm, args, ctx) → {text, image?, structured?, isError?} }.
// Front-ends call runTool(), which resolves the call's host and VM against their Session and runs the
// tool on that host. ctx: { signal, session, host, current, localCwd, localCopy?, progress?, approve? }.
// progress(message) reports a status line while the tool runs (MCP progress notifications); front-ends
// without it pass nothing. localCopy limits vm_copy's local: endpoints (see copyTool); front-ends that run
// on the user's own machine pass nothing.
//   engine: pi runs this tool with its own built-in engine (same rendering/truncation as bash, read, …)
//   noVm:   the front-end does not resolve a VM; the tool gets every argument, `vm` included
//           (vm_copy, vm_manage, vm_info, vm_lease)
// "Current VM", the session's host and held leases are front-end state: vm_manage and vm_lease change
// them only through the Session hooks.
