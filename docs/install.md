← [Docs](README.md)

boxery has two halves:

- **The VM host** runs the VMs, the LLM credential proxy and the lease reaper. It can be a Linux box with KVM (recommended), a Mac with Lima, or any machine with ssh driving VMs on exe.dev or boat.dev (both experimental). It can also drive headless [OpenShell](openshell.md) sandboxes (experimental).
- **The controller** is the `boxery` CLI on your laptop (Node + ssh). The pi extension and the MCP server run the same code.

They can be the same machine.

## Choosing a backend

| VMs run on | The host runs on | Backend | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Your Mac | The same Mac | [`lima`](#macos-host-lima) | Stable |
| A physical Linux machine (KVM) | The same machine | [`libvirt`](#linux-host-libvirtkvm), [`cloud-hypervisor`](#linux-host-cloud-hypervisor-experimental) | libvirt: stable, fastest. Cloud Hypervisor: experimental |
| exe.dev (cloud) | Your local machine, or any remote machine with ssh (e.g. a VPS) | [`exe`](#exedev-experimental) | Experimental |
| boat.dev (cloud) | Your local machine, or any remote machine with ssh (e.g. a VPS) | [`boat`](#boatdev-experimental) | Experimental |
| OpenShell sandboxes (Linux) | Any machine that can reach an OpenShell gateway | [`openshell`](#policy-enforced-headless-sandboxes-openshell-experimental) | Experimental. Headless only: no desktop, snapshots, forks or pools |

- **To try it out**, use the machine you're on: Lima on a Mac, libvirt on a Linux desktop or laptop. Everything stays local.
- **For the fastest VMs**, use a physical Linux machine: a home server, an old desktop, or a dedicated server. A VPS works only if it offers nested virtualization (check for `/dev/kvm`), and most don't.
- **With no hardware of your own**, run the VMs on exe.dev or boat.dev. The host can stay on your local machine, but it keeps a tunnel open to each VM and agents lose their LLM while it sleeps, so for long-running work put it on an always-on machine such as a small VPS.
- **For locked-down headless work**, use OpenShell. Its policy limits what each sandbox can read and reach on the network, but there's no root, desktop, snapshots, forks or pool.

Agents see the same tools on every backend, except OpenShell, which has only the shell, file and job tools. One MCP server can [route across several hosts](hosts.md), and one machine can run [two backends side by side](#a-second-backend-on-the-same-machine).

## Linux host (libvirt/KVM)

**Requirements**

- KVM (`/dev/kvm` readable)
- libvirt on `qemu:///system`, with your user in the `libvirt` group, and its nwfilter driver (`virtnwfilterd`, or the monolithic `libvirtd`), which isolates guests
- `virt-install`, `qemu-img`, `cloud-localds` (from `cloud-image-utils`)
- `socat`, `nc`
- Node ≥ 22.13 (the lease store uses `node:sqlite`)
- systemd user services. Turn on linger so the proxy and reaper keep running after you log out:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

**Install**

```bash
npm install -g boxery-vm            # or: git clone https://github.com/modem-dev/boxery.git && use ./host/boxery-host
boxery-host init                 # storage pool, proxy + vsock + reaper user services, ~/.local/bin symlinks
boxery-host build-base           # golden image: XFCE, VNC, Chrome, Firefox, Node 24, pi, opencode (~3 min)
```

`init` symlinks `boxery-host` into `~/.local/bin`. The controller expects it there. The proxy and reaper services point at the installed package path and the node and tools found on your `PATH` at `init` time, so after switching Node versions with nvm/fnm re-run `boxery-host init`. To update boxery itself, see [Upgrading](#upgrading).

**Guest network isolation.** VMs share libvirt's `default` NAT network, and each one's interface carries a libvirt network filter (nwfilter `boxery-guest-isolation`). A guest reaches the internet, and DHCP and DNS on the host's bridge address, and nothing else: not the host's sshd or other services, other guests, your LAN, Tailscale, cloud metadata (`169.254.169.254`) or any other private range, and it can't take another guest's MAC or IP. The LLM proxy goes over vsock, which the filter doesn't touch. Details: [security](security.md#what-a-vm-can-and-cant-reach).

- New VMs, forks, reverts and lease resets get the filter. A VM made before this release gets it from its next cold start: `init` (which `upgrade` runs) adds it to every VM's configuration, and `boxery stop NAME && boxery start NAME` applies it. A VM that is still running keeps the open network until then.
- Guests that must reach LAN services (a dev database, an internal registry) can't while isolated. To turn isolation off for every VM of this host, set it in `host.env` (or `BOXERY_NET_ISOLATION=off boxery-host init`), then restart the VMs:

  ```bash
  echo BOXERY_NET_ISOLATION=off >>~/.config/boxery/host.env
  boxery stop NAME && boxery start NAME     # start removes the filter; new VMs get none
  ```

  Remove the line (or set `on`) and restart the VMs to turn it back on.
- `BOXERY_NET` must be a libvirt network with an IPv4 address on a private range (libvirt's `default` is `192.168.122.0/24`); isolation drops guest-to-guest traffic because the network itself is in a blocked range.

## Policy-enforced headless sandboxes (OpenShell, experimental)

Install/start OpenShell first, then let Boxery discover its authenticated gateway and configure the restricted backend:

```bash
boxery setup local --backend openshell
boxery --host restricted new demo --headless
```

Setup builds/selects the image, saves an offline starter policy, chooses a namespace and registers the host—without importing credentials or requiring a guest SSH key. Use `--gateway NAME` when several gateways exist, `--image OCI` for a remote gateway, and `--yes` for noninteractive setup. OpenShell still manages its own installation, TLS and services. See [OpenShell setup and limitations](openshell.md).

## macOS host (Lima)

No Linux box? Run the host on your Mac and point the controller at `local`. The laptop and the host are then the same machine.

```bash
brew install lima jq node   # jq: the Lima backend reads limactl's JSON with it
npm install -g boxery-vm
boxery-host init --backend lima
boxery-host build-base
boxery setup local
```

Lima maps the guest's gateway (`192.168.5.2`) to your Mac's `127.0.0.1`. boxery starts every Lima instance under `sandbox-exec` so that guests reach only the LLM proxy there, not Ollama's admin API, the HTTP MCP server or your dev databases. Services listening on the Mac's other addresses (`0.0.0.0`, LAN, Tailscale) stay reachable from guests, and VMs started outside boxery (`limactl start`) aren't confined: [security → known limits](security.md#known-limits).

Apple Silicon notes:

- The guest is arm64, so `vm_browser` uses Playwright's Chromium instead of Google Chrome. Google ships no Linux arm64 build.
- Lima's default `vz` VM type is fast, but it can't snapshot. Set `BOXERY_LIMA_VMTYPE=qemu` (before `init`) if you need `snap` and `revert`, or if you want to use the [shared pool](pool.md).

## Linux host (Cloud Hypervisor, experimental)

An alternative to libvirt on Linux: no libvirtd, and a routed TAP per VM with guest isolation in nftables (guests can't reach the host, each other or your LAN). It needs Cloud Hypervisor, a firmware file, nftables and passwordless sudo for network setup. Requirements and layout: [backends → cloud-hypervisor](../host/backends/README.md#cloud-hypervisor-experimental).

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_admin+ep "$(command -v cloud-hypervisor)"
./host/boxery-host init --backend cloud-hypervisor
./host/boxery-host build-base
```

## exe.dev (experimental)

No KVM at all: run the VMs on [exe.dev](https://exe.dev) and the host (proxy, leases, tunnels) on any Linux box or Mac with ssh. You need an exe.dev account whose ssh key this machine offers first. If `ssh exe.dev whoami` says "Please complete registration", run `ssh exe.dev` in a terminal and enter your account's email to add the key.

```bash
ssh exe.dev whoami
npm install -g boxery-vm
boxery-host init --backend exe       # BOXERY_EXE_KEY=~/.ssh/id_exe to use a dedicated key
boxery-host build-base               # ~3 min on an exeuntu VM, then kept paused as the base
boxery setup local                   # or: boxery setup you@this-host
```

A VM can be as large as your exe.dev plan allows (boxery reads the limits from `ssh exe.dev billing plan`); on Personal, all your VMs share that capacity. `BOXERY_EXE_MAX_CPUS` / `BOXERY_EXE_MAX_MEM` set a lower limit, or a Work pool's size. `stop` pauses a VM. Layout, security notes and what's still unverified: [backends → exe](../host/backends/README.md#exe-experimental).

**Run the host on an always-on machine.** The VMs are in the cloud, but the host keeps one ssh tunnel per VM open to exe.dev, and that tunnel carries both the VM's ssh endpoint and the agents' only route to the LLM proxy. When the host sleeps or goes offline, every running agent loses its LLM in the middle of a task, and no controller can reach the VMs. The VMs keep running and the tunnels reconnect by themselves (within seconds) once the host is back. So put `boxery-host --backend exe` on a machine that stays up, such as a home server, a small Linux VPS or a desktop that doesn't sleep, and use your laptop as a controller only (`boxery setup you@that-host`). This keeps the security model: provider credentials stay on that machine and never enter a VM. On a Linux host, turn on linger (`sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"`, as above) so the tunnels, which are systemd user units, keep running when you're logged out. `boxery-host init` warns when this host has a battery, since it is probably a laptop that sleeps. If you do run the host on a laptop, keep it awake while agents work (on a Mac, for example `caffeinate -s` on AC power).

**exe.dev integrations work alongside boxery's grants.** exe.dev [integrations](https://exe.dev/docs/integrations) (its `llm`, HTTP proxies, GitHub, S3, workload identity) give a VM credentials that exe.dev holds. boxery lets you use them, but they bypass its proxy and grants: no `boxery grant`, no per-VM revoke, no confirmation. New accounts attach `llm` to every VM, so agents in boxery's VMs can use your exe.dev LLM credits without an `llm:` grant. `boxery-host init`, `new`, `start` and reverts warn about each credential integration that reaches a VM (`reflection` and `notify` hold none), with the command to detach it. To keep agents to boxery's grants, detach them (for example `ssh exe.dev integrations detach llm auto:all`; detaching from `auto:all` affects your other exe.dev VMs too). Integrations you mean to use can go in `BOXERY_EXE_ALLOW_INTEGRATIONS=NAME,…` to stop the warning. See [the exe backend](../host/backends/README.md#exe-experimental).

`boxery-host ls` shows a running VM whose tunnel isn't connected as `tunnel connecting` (it is retrying) or `tunnel down` (it isn't running; `boxery-host start NAME` brings it back) in place of its address. Commands that need the VM say the same thing rather than waiting for ssh to time out.

## boat.dev (experimental)

Also no KVM: run the VMs as [boat.dev](https://boat.dev) sandboxes (full Ubuntu VMs) and the host on any Linux box or Mac with ssh. You need a **paid** boat plan: images (the base, snapshots, forks, the pool's clean states) are boat saved snapshots, which the free trial refuses. (The trial also requires auto-stop: `BOXERY_BOAT_TTL=7200`.) Create an API key in the boat dashboard.

```bash
npm install -g boxery-vm
BOAT_API_KEY=boat_… boxery-host init --backend boat   # saves the key in ~/.local/share/boxery/boat/api-key (0600)
boxery-host build-base                                # a builder sandbox, saved as the base, then deleted
boxery setup local                                    # or: boxery setup you@this-host
```

VM sizes are boat's four types: a VM gets the smallest that fits (`small` 2 vCPU/4 GB, `default` 4/8, `large` 8/16; `xlarge` with `BOXERY_BOAT_MAX_TYPE=xlarge` on the $100 plan). `stop` is a real stop, and boat keeps a stopped VM's disk for 14 days. Each VM is reached through an ssh tunnel the host keeps open, so the host must stay up. Saved snapshots beyond your plan's allowance cost $0.056 a day each. Layout and what's still unverified: [backends → boat](../host/backends/README.md#boat-experimental).

### A second backend on the same machine

Already running a host (say Lima) and want exe.dev or boat.dev VMs from the same machine? Add it as a second host profile from the controller. It gets its own state, proxy port and services, so it doesn't touch the first one:

```bash
boxery host add exe local --backend exe     # or: you@my-host
boxery --host exe build-base
boxery --host exe new demo
```

See [Named hosts → several backends on one machine](hosts.md#several-backends-on-one-machine).

Backend details: [host/backends/README.md](../host/backends/README.md).

## Laptop / controller

Needs Node ≥ 22.13, ssh and a browser (and bash, which macOS and Linux have).

```bash
npm install -g boxery-vm            # or: git clone + ln -s ~/boxery/controller/boxery onto your PATH
boxery setup you@my-host                                    # or: boxery setup local
```

`setup` checks that ssh to the host works and registers your public key, which goes into VMs created from then on. It registers the host under a name (`local`, or the host part of `you@my-host`; pass `--name` to choose) and makes it the default if it's your first, writing its config to `~/.boxery/profiles/NAME/`. Running `setup` again for the same name reconfigures that host. To add more hosts, see [Named hosts](hosts.md). Your laptop must already be able to `ssh you@my-host`. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) is the easy way to reach the host from anywhere.

**Optional: plain `ssh` to VMs.** `setup` prints an `Include` line for your default host; add it to the **top** of `~/.ssh/config`. For a host named `local`:

```
Include ~/.boxery/profiles/local/ssh_config
```

After that, `ssh demo.boxery`, VS Code / Cursor Remote-SSH and Zed remote all work.

Next: hook up an agent with the [pi extension](pi-extension.md) or the [MCP server](mcp.md).

## LLM providers for in-VM agents

pi and opencode come preinstalled in every VM and are already pointed at the host's [credential proxy](security.md#credential-proxy). VMs never hold real keys, and a VM can't use any provider until you grant it: `boxery grant demo llm:chatgpt` (or `boxery new demo --grant llm:chatgpt`). See [Grants](grants.md). You only need these if you run agents **inside** VMs (`boxery attach`, `boxery prompt`). Laptop agents using `vm_*` tools use your laptop's own login.

| Provider | Set up on the host | Grant to a VM |
|---|---|---|
| ChatGPT / Codex | Run `pi` on the host once and `/login`. The proxy reuses `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` and refreshes it. | `llm:chatgpt` |
| OpenAI, Anthropic API | Put `OPENAI_API_KEY=…` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=…` in `~/.config/boxery/proxy.env`. If the OpenAI key belongs to several organizations or projects, set `OPENAI_ORG_ID=…` / `OPENAI_PROJECT_ID=…` there too: VMs can't pick one themselves | `llm:openai`, `llm:anthropic` |
| Ollama | Auto-detected on `127.0.0.1:11434`. Its tool-capable models are configured for pi and opencode. | `llm:ollama` |

## Verify

```bash
boxery new demo          # ~13 s
boxery run demo uname -a
boxery desktop demo      # opens the XFCE desktop in your browser
boxery rm demo
```

To check everything at once, run `./e2e.sh` from the controller. It covers create, in-VM agents, proxy, desktop, extension, grants, leases, snapshots and rm.

## Upgrading

From the controller:

```bash
boxery version                      # controller and host versions; warns when the host is behind
boxery upgrade-host --check         # what would change, without changing it
boxery upgrade-host                 # or: boxery --host hornet upgrade-host
```

Or on the host itself: `boxery-host upgrade [--check]`.

Upgrading the host doesn't touch the software inside existing VMs. When a release changes the image layers, `boxery ls` lists the VMs built with the old ones as `outdated`; `boxery patch NAME` (or `--all`) brings them up to date ([details](cli.md#lifecycle)).

`upgrade` works out how boxery is installed on the host and updates it in place:

- **git checkout** on a branch: `git pull --ff-only` from its upstream. It refuses a checkout with uncommitted changes or local commits. A detached checkout moves to the newest `v*` tag.
- **global npm install**: `npm install -g boxery-vm@latest`. It never downgrades unless you pass `--ref`.
- `--ref REF` pins a tag, branch or npm version, including an older one.

It then re-runs `init` for **every profile whose services run that install**. For example, it re-runs both the libvirt profile and a second Lima profile with its own `BOXERY_CONF`. Each profile keeps the node its services already use. Services that belong to other installs are listed and left alone.

Before changing anything, it waits for VM operations already in flight in each profile to finish, up to `--wait` seconds (600 by default). It exits with code 75 if they don't finish in time, and nothing changes. New operations wait behind the upgrade (see [lifecycle](lifecycle.md)).

After `init`, it checks every profile the way its services run. `boxery-host ls` must work with the reaper's `PATH`, the lease store must open (`boxery-host pool ls`), and the LLM proxy must answer `/healthz`. If any check fails, the code goes back to the previous version, each profile's state goes back to its pre-upgrade copy, and `init` runs again.

**The pre-upgrade copy.** Before it changes the code, `upgrade` saves each profile's state in `$BOXERY_CONF/pre-upgrade/` (`~/.config/boxery/pre-upgrade/` for the default profile). It holds a consistent copy of `leases.db` (leases, operations and each VM's record), made with `VACUUM INTO` while no operation runs, plus `tokens.json` and `edge/`. A rollback restores all of it, because the new version may have migrated the lease store or rewritten those files. (The copy is taken by the version being upgraded from. Releases before VM records moved into `leases.db` also copy `vm-shapes/`, `vm-kind/` and `vm-os/`.) The database is restored in place, so processes that have it open see the old contents. Leases taken before the upgrade carry on. A claim made during the upgrade is undone, and its client gets an error and can retry.

The copy stays after a successful upgrade, until the next upgrade replaces it. It is the way back if the new version turns out to be broken in a way the checks didn't catch. For each profile, with no boxery command running:

```bash
systemctl --user stop boxery-proxy boxery-reaper.timer    # macOS: launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/dev.boxery-proxy (and dev.boxery-reaper)
# put the previous version back: git checkout <old commit>, or npm install -g boxery-vm@<old version>
cd ~/.config/boxery                                        # or the profile's BOXERY_CONF
rm -f leases.db-wal leases.db-shm && cp pre-upgrade/leases.db leases.db
cp pre-upgrade/tokens.json . && for d in edge vm-shapes vm-kind vm-os; do rm -rf "$d"; [ ! -d "pre-upgrade/$d" ] || cp -R "pre-upgrade/$d" .; done
boxery-host init                                           # restarts the services
```

Anything recorded since the upgrade is lost: leases, new VMs' tokens and sizes, edge grants. Restore soon after the upgrade, and recreate what you need.

The lease store records its schema version. A boxery older than the store refuses to open it, with an error that says so, rather than misreading it. So `--ref` to a release older than the store's schema fails its checks and rolls back. Releases from before the version was recorded (0.8 and earlier) don't check it, so going back to one isn't supported: it would run on the newer store, without the VM records it holds (each VM's kind, guest OS and size), and VMs made meanwhile would lose them when you upgrade again.

Hosts installed before `upgrade` existed need one manual update, on the host:

```bash
cd ~/boxery && git pull --ff-only    # or: npm update -g boxery-vm
boxery-host init                     # and boxery-host --profile NAME init (or BOXERY_CONF=… boxery-host init) for each extra profile
```

`upgrade-host` is a CLI command for you, not a `vm_*` tool. Agents can see version skew with `vm_info {action:"version"}`. They are told to pass the upgrade on to you rather than run it. An agent that could swap the code next to your credentials is a risk the read-only tools don't carry.
