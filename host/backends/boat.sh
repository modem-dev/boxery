# boxery backend: boat.dev (https://boat.dev). Sourced by host/boxery-host. EXPERIMENTAL.
# Contract: see host/backends/README.md ("Remote backends" for the shared tunnel model, lib/remote.sh).
#
# - VMs are boat sandboxes (full Ubuntu 24.04 VMs), managed through boat's REST API (lib/boat.mjs: requests,
#   JSON, polling; curl underneath) and an API key (BOAT_API_KEY, saved by init in $BOAT_DIR/api-key). No KVM
#   on the host, so it runs on macOS too. This file keeps the backend contract, ssh and the tunnels.
# - Sandboxes are named PREFIXvm-NAME (VMs) and PREFIXbuild (the builder). PREFIX (default "bx<6 hex>-",
#   generated once into $BOAT_DIR/prefix) keeps the account's other sandboxes out of reach. Names, not
#   labels: boat drops the labels of a sandbox created from a saved snapshot.
#   A VM's sandbox id (bx_…) changes with every disk it gets (new, revert, pool reset); the current one
#   is $BOAT_DIR/vms/NAME/id.
# - ssh: boat runs a real sshd (user `user`, passwordless sudo) and authorizes keys over the API
#   (POST /sandboxes/ID/sshkey answers the address and the host key to pin). The host's own key
#   ($BOAT_DIR/id_ed25519) is the admin channel: build, identity, sync. Each VM gets one supervised
#   tunnel as `user`: -L 127.0.0.1:PORT → guest :22 (the VM's endpoint), -R guest :GPORT → host proxy.
#   Every resume puts the sandbox on a new machine (new address, new host key): start re-pins it and
#   rewrites the tunnel.
# - The guest's sshd is public (boat needs it), so the base lets `agent` in from loopback only (the
#   tunnel's end): the lease holder's key can't bypass the host.
# - Images (snapshots, forks, pool resets; disk only, see README) are saved snapshots, named
#   PREFIXi-HASH (saved snapshot names are [a-z0-9-]); the image name and disk are kept in
#   $BOAT_DIR/images/. A saved snapshot is an exact, independent copy of a running or stopped sandbox.
#   new --from = POST /sandboxes {from}; reimage = a new sandbox from the image, then delete the old one.
# - stop = POST /stop (boat saves the disk and drops the machine: memory and tmpfs grants are gone, as
#   after a shutdown); start = POST /resume.
# - Sizes are boat's four types (small 2/4, default 4/8, large 8/16, xlarge 16/32 vCPU/GB): a VM gets the
#   smallest one that fits, up to BOXERY_BOAT_MAX_TYPE. resize = stop, then resume with the new type.
# - Sandboxes are created with noEnv (none of the account's environment, logins or CLI token; they can't
#   act on the account) and without auto-stop.
