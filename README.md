> [!WARNING]
> **Early-stage, experimental software.** Expect rough edges and breaking changes between releases.

boxery lets your agents manage their own Linux VMs: on your Mac, a Linux server, a sandbox provider like exe.dev or boat.dev, or all of them at once. Your agent stays on your machine with your login and setup; the VM is where it works, and your keys never go in.

## Quick start

Give this prompt to your agent:

```text
Read github.com/modem-dev/boxery and set up boxery on this machine.
Then spin up a VM with `boxery new demo` and open its desktop.
```

Prefer to do it by hand? See [Install](#install).

## What it's for

- **Dev boxes.** A full Linux machine per project or branch. `ssh demo.boxery`, or open it in VS Code.
- **Safe sandboxes.** Let an agent install anything and run code you don't trust, away from your laptop and your keys.
- **Parallel attempts.** Fork a running VM, try three fixes at once, keep the one that works.
- **Browser and desktop tasks.** Chrome, clicks and screenshots on a real desktop you can watch live.
- **Always-on agents and long jobs.** Run them on a server or in the cloud, and they keep going after you close your laptop.

## Why boxery

- **Built for agents.** Agents create, fork and drive VMs themselves over [MCP](docs/mcp.md): Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, opencode or any MCP client, plus a native [pi](docs/pi-extension.md) extension.
- **Fast.** A full desktop VM in about 13 s on libvirt, or a [headless](docs/cli.md#lifecycle) one with no desktop at all. Snapshot a running VM in about 1 s.
- **Mix VM providers.** One MCP server drives your Mac, a Linux server and sandbox providers (exe.dev, boat.dev) [at once](docs/hosts.md), with the same tools on each.
- **Your credentials never enter a VM.** VMs get a revocable token, and the host swaps in your real key. A VM gets nothing by default, not even an LLM, until you [grant it](docs/grants.md).

## How it works

- **On your machine**, the boxery MCP server (or pi extension) gives your agent the `vm_*` tools.
- **The boxery host** is a machine you run: your Mac, a Linux box, or a small VPS for cloud VMs. The tools reach it over ssh. It holds your keys and grants, and creates, forks and wipes VMs.
- **The VMs** are untrusted. They run anything, and hold only a revocable token that the host swaps for your real key.

Your machine and the host can be the same one. [Security model →](docs/security.md)

It creates, forks and wipes untrusted VMs on Lima, libvirt, exe.dev or boat.dev, and each VM holds only a revocable token that the proxy swaps for your real key." width="680">
  </picture>
</p>

## Platforms

The host runs VMs on your Mac, on Linux, or in the cloud. Each backend is a stack of existing tools, and boxery drives the top of it, so agents get the same tools on every one except OpenShell. One MCP server can drive several hosts [at once](docs/hosts.md). [Choosing a backend →](docs/install.md#choosing-a-backend)

    <img src="docs/diagrams/layers-light.svg" alt="What runs a boxery VM, layer by layer. The boxery host is the orchestrator over every backend. On macOS, Lima (local): limactl manages Apple's Virtualization.framework, on the macOS kernel's hypervisor, on Apple silicon. On Linux: libvirt (fastest) manages QEMU; Cloud Hypervisor (minimal, experimental) is managed by boxery itself, with a systemd unit per VM; both run on KVM in the Linux kernel. OpenShell (restricted, experimental) goes through its gateway to a container that shares the host kernel, with no VM. In the cloud, exe.dev and boat (experimental), with no hardware, are reached through their API, and the rest runs on their servers." width="680">
  </picture>
</p>

- **macOS: Lima.** VMs on the Mac you're on, through Apple's Virtualization framework. The quickest way to try boxery, and everything stays local.
- **Linux: libvirt.** QEMU on KVM, and the fastest backend. Use a physical machine: a desktop, a laptop or a home server. A VPS works only if it offers nested virtualization.
- **Cloud: exe.dev.** VMs on exe.dev, with no hardware of your own. The host keeps a tunnel to each VM, so put it on an always-on machine such as a small VPS, and use your laptop as a controller.

### Experimental

- **Linux: Cloud Hypervisor.** A leaner VMM on the same KVM, with no libvirt: boxery manages it itself, with a systemd unit per VM.
- **Linux: [OpenShell](docs/openshell.md).** Headless sandboxes from [NVIDIA's OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell), behind its gateway, with a policy on what each one can read and reach. With its Docker driver they're containers on the host's kernel, not VMs. No desktop, snapshots, forks or pool.
- **Cloud: boat.dev.** VMs on boat.dev, with no hardware of your own. For long-running work, keep the host on an always-on machine such as a small VPS.

## Install

The easiest way is to give this prompt to your agent:

```text
Read github.com/modem-dev/boxery and set up boxery on this machine.
Then spin up a VM with `boxery new demo` and open its desktop.
```

Or by hand, on a Mac:

```bash
brew install lima jq node   # jq: the Lima backend reads limactl's JSON with it
npm install -g boxery-vm
boxery-host init --backend lima && boxery-host build-base
boxery setup local
```

`build-base` builds the desktop image once (about 3 min); skip it if you only want headless VMs. On Linux or in the cloud, see the [install guide](docs/install.md#choosing-a-backend).

Then connect your agent:

```bash
npx add-mcp boxery-vm      # Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, VS Code, opencode, Zed, …
pi install npm:boxery-vm   # or the native pi extension
```

And ask: *"Clone my repo in a VM, start the dev server, and screenshot the homepage in Chrome."*

## What your agent gets

| Tools | |
|---|---|
| `vm_bash` `vm_read` `vm_write` `vm_edit` `vm_jobs` `vm_copy` | Shell, files and background jobs |
| `vm_screenshot` `vm_click` `vm_type` `vm_key` `vm_scroll` `vm_browser` | Computer use and Playwright on the desktop |
| `vm_manage` `vm_info` | Create, fork, snapshot, revert and remove VMs |
| `vm_grant` `vm_lease` | Ask you to grant access (GitHub, ssh-agent, env vars), or lease a VM from a shared pool |

You can also drive VMs yourself with the [CLI](docs/cli.md): `boxery attach demo`, `boxery desktop demo`.
